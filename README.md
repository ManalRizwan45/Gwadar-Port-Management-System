# Gwadar-Port-Management-System
I have developed a Genetic Algorithm-based Gwadar Port Management System comprising two modules:
  1. Scheduling of in-bound and out-bound ships.
  2. Dynamic planning for loading and unloading freight.
The system incorporates three jetties/dockyards (J1, J2, and J3) accommodating various types of ships/vessels with differing arrival and departure times, as well as varying passenger/crew capacities based on their sizes. Utilizing Genetic Algorithms, the system efficiently manages port traffic by optimizing ship scheduling and freight handling processes while considering constraints such as port ground handling procedures and ship-specific limitations.
